# CaesarCipher

## Description

> This is a Java application allows the user to enter words they would wish to encode and decode then it returns an encrypted or decrypted text.

> The user can encode a plaintext by providing a cipher key and produce an encoded text, also decodes an encoded text to plain text.

## How it Works

* Encoding a plain text using a cipher key
* Decoding an encoded text to plain text also using a cipher key
* Allowing only the 26 alpabets, while avoiding symbols, digits and special characters
* Validating the cipher key
* Writing JUnit tests.
